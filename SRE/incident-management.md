### **What is incident?**
An incident is an unplanned interruption that leads to the IT service.

### **What is Incident Management?**  

**Incident management** is the **process of identifying, responding to, and resolving IT issues** to minimize disruption to services. It ensures that systems remain **reliable and available** for users.  

---

### **Simple Explanation with Example**  
Imagine you are using an **online banking app**, and suddenly, the app **stops working**. This is an **incident** because it affects users.  

The **incident management process** would look like this:  
1. **Detection** → Monitoring tools detect the issue (e.g., server crash).  
2. **Alerting** → An alert is sent to the IT team.  
3. **Investigation** → Engineers analyze the root cause.  
4. **Resolution** → The issue is fixed (e.g., restarting the server).  
5. **Post-Incident Review** → The team documents what happened and takes steps to prevent future incidents.

### **Why is Incident Management Important?**  
- Reduces downtime and service disruption.  
- Ensures quick response to critical issues.  
- Improves system reliability and customer trust.  

---

### **Example of Incident Management Tools**  
- **IT Service Management (ITSM) tools** → ServiceNow, Jira Service Management.  
- **Alerting tools** → PagerDuty, Opsgenie.  
- **Monitoring tools** → Prometheus, Datadog, CloudWatch.  

---

### **Incident Management Workflow (Step-by-Step Example)**  

Incident management follows a structured **workflow** to quickly detect, respond, and resolve issues. Below is a **typical incident management process** in IT and DevOps environments.  

---

### **1. Detection & Logging**  
**Goal:** Identify and record the issue.  

 **Example:**  
- A **server goes down** due to high CPU usage.  
- A **monitoring tool** (e.g., **Prometheus, CloudWatch, Datadog**) detects the issue.  
- An **alert** is triggered and logged in an **ITSM tool** (e.g., **ServiceNow, Jira Service Management**).  

---

### **2. Categorization & Prioritization**  
**Goal:** Classify the incident based on severity and impact.  

 **Example:**  
- **Critical Incident** → A banking app is **completely down** (High impact, urgent fix needed).  
- **Major Incident** → A few customers face **slow transactions** (Medium impact).  
- **Minor Incident** → A button on the app is **misaligned** (Low impact, no urgency).  

 **Priority Levels:**  
- **P1 (Critical)** → Immediate action required (e.g., System outage).  
- **P2 (High)** → Significant issue but not critical (e.g., Performance issue).  
- **P3 (Medium)** → Limited impact (e.g., Partial service disruption).  
- **P4 (Low)** → Minor issue (e.g., UI bug).

### **3. Incident Assignment**  
**Goal:** Assign the incident to the right team or engineer.  

 **Example:**  
- A **database issue** is assigned to the **DBA (Database Administrator)**.  
- A **network issue** is assigned to the **Network Team**.  
- A **server crash** is assigned to the **DevOps/SRE Team**.  

---

### **4. Investigation & Diagnosis**  
**Goal:** Find the root cause of the incident.  

 **Example:**  
- Engineers check **logs, metrics, and alerts** to identify the problem.  
- Use **commands like** `journalctl -xe`, `kubectl logs`, `docker logs`, or `systemctl status` to debug.  
- If needed, **escalate to senior engineers** or specialists.  

---

### **5. Resolution & Recovery**  
**Goal:** Fix the issue and restore the service.  

 **Example:**  
- If a **server is down**, restart it using `systemctl restart nginx`.  
- If a **database query is slow**, optimize the query or **increase resources**.  
- If a **container crashes**, restart the pod using `kubectl rollout restart deployment`.  

After resolution:  
- **Verify that the service is working.**  
- **Close the incident ticket.**  

---

### **6. Post-Incident Review & Documentation**  
**Goal:** Learn from the incident and prevent future issues.  

 **Example:**  
- Document the **root cause, impact, and resolution steps**.  
- Conduct a **Post-Mortem Analysis** to discuss improvements.  
- Implement **automations** to prevent similar incidents.  

 **Example:** If a server crashed due to **high CPU usage**, set up **Auto-Scaling** in AWS to handle future traffic spikes.  

---

### **Incident Management Workflow Summary**  

| Step | Action | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **1. Detection & Logging** | Identify the issue | Monitoring detects a server crash |
| **2. Categorization & Prioritization** | Assign priority | P1 (Critical) - Banking app is down |
| **3. Assignment** | Assign to team | DevOps team handles server crash |
| **4. Investigation & Diagnosis** | Find the root cause | Check logs and resource usage |
| **5. Resolution & Recovery** | Fix the issue | Restart server, scale up resources |
| **6. Post-Incident Review** | Learn & prevent future issues | Document incident, implement auto-scaling |

### **Real-World Example: Incident in a Kubernetes Cluster**  

 **Scenario:**  
- A Kubernetes pod running an **Nginx service** crashes.  
- **Prometheus and Grafana** detect high memory usage.  
- **AlertManager** sends an alert to **PagerDuty**.  
- **SRE Team investigates the issue using `kubectl logs` and `kubectl describe pod`**.  
- **Fix:** Increase memory limits and restart the pod using `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`  
- **Post-Incident:** Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (`kubectl autoscale deployment`) to prevent future crashes.
