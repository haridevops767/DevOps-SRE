### **Response Time vs. Resolution Time in Simple Terms**  

**Response Time** and **Resolution Time** are key metrics in IT support and incident management.  

1. **Response Time** – How fast the team acknowledges the issue.  
2. **Resolution Time** – How long it takes to fix the issue completely.  

### **Example:**  
- A user reports that the company website is down at **10:00 AM**.  
- The IT team **acknowledges** the issue at **10:05 AM**.  
- The IT team **fixes** the issue, and the website is back online at **10:30 AM**.  

In this case:  
- **Response Time** = 5 minutes (time taken to acknowledge the issue).  
- **Resolution Time** = 30 minutes (time taken to fully resolve the issue).
