Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) Summary

What is a Pod Disruption Budget (PDB)?

A Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) in Kubernetes ensures that a certain number or percentage of pods remain available during voluntary disruptions (e.g., node upgrades, maintenance). PDB prevents excessive pod disruptions while allowing controlled evictions.
